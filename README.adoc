The fixture starts off with three example sewer ``Segment``s:

For example, the first sewer `Segment` is set up with a number of (example) ``ElementSpec``s (specifying the plan for the construction of an element of the sewer segment):

The first example `ElementSpec` is set up with a number of ``ProductionStepSpec``s.  These step specs are pre-defined reference data; some are "basic" (likely to be associated with all elements), some are "extra", ie optional:

Additional steps can be added to the specification of the `ElementSpec`:

Once an element has been fully specified/planned, its construction (as a physical `ConcreteElement`) can be commissioned.  Each such requires a production Id:

The resultant `ConcreteElement` refers back to the `ElementSpec` from which it was created, and has corresponding ``ProductionStep``s that relate back to the plan.  These ``ProductionStep``s keep track of their status; initially none is started:

We can then complete any of these steps.  (In this demo, there are no rules as to the order in which steps are completed):

The `ConcreteElement` can used to see the overall status of its steps; we see one of the steps now completed:

We can continue, completing the second step.  (Note that the first step - previously completed - is no longer shown):

and so on, and so on:
